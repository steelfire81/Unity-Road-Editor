# Unity Road Editor

A second attempt at making an easy-to-use road editor for Unity.

**Currently a work in progress!**  Currently, generated roads are rough and need improvement.  Expect features and controls to change regularly until a more stable version is uploaded.

## How to Use
1. Create an empty GameObject and attach a **MeshFilter**, **MeshRenderer**, **MeshCollider**, and a **MeshRoad** script.
2. Click the empty checkbox in the inspector labeled "Enable Drawing".
3. In the scene view, click anywhere and draw the desired road path, releasing the mouse button when done.
4. Click the "Generate Road" button to build the road.
